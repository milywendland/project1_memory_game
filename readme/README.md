### **_Description_**

#### I want to make one of those memory card games! I think I would like to have 12 "cards" in total, with 6 sets of two matching cards. I would like to have a timer that counted down between each card matchup. There would also need to be a way to have the cards switch places after every game. I think realistically, this will be something that I can acheive and make it look really cute. I want to have something that I am really proud of at the end of this project.

### **_Getting Started_**

#### To get started, I've decided what I want the cards to look like. I need to become best friends with css grid. I'll definitely be playing grid garden a lot. I will be looking back over our lessons. Working on the Trello board.
